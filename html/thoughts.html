    <h2>Adventures with blogging on Github</h2>

    This is my first post with a promise to write more! I'm trying to figure out how to automatically parse files
    so they end up in a post format. If this was hosted on a server I would install a database and set up any number of
    blogging platforms. However it's proving to be difficult to set up a blogging platform without any sort of backend
    that Github pages offer.

    <h4>What I've tried so far:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Using <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll ">Jekyll</a>, Github's built in static
            website builder and blogging tool.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Why I'm not using it:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It's not like I don't like this tool, I've heard great success with it from friends. But I have already built the
            rest of this site using custom made HTML/CSS/JS and until there is good reasons to change it, I feel like keeping
            everything custom built.
        </li>
    </ul>

    Since I wanted something up on this page I'm writing this post right into the main blog file. When I got some
    more time I will look into this again and see if I can figure out any ideas.
